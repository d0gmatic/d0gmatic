Hi, I’m @d0gmatic, you can also call me d0g or d0gma. I’m interested in Pokémon ROM Hacking and just learning more about coding. I'm currently learning Python, but I think learn some form of C will be necessary for Pokémon. I'm definitely ambitious with my aspirations in ROM Hacking, and if anyone wants to hear about it or wants to reach out otherwise, my email is roreilly04@gmail.com and my discord tag is d0gma#6740.
